The Popular Movie App reads data from TheMovieDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb


To test the project you need a Developer API key from The Movie DB. To get your API key got to https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction and follow the steps to register your key.
Once you have  a key, go to `gradle.properties` and paste the key into this `API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` value.

To discover API features go to official documentation https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.
